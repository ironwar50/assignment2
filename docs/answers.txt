2. 8 commits. I used: git log

4. Branches are used so that someone can work on a project without affecting others.
It can be used so that changes can be made in stages to limit potential negative affects
to the main project. 

5. git status tells you whether or not you branch is up to date with the master. git log 
list commits made.

6. git log --follow Vehicle.h

7. git log --grep="file"

8. Inheritence is the concept that subclass can derive features from base class
Polymorhpism is the ability of objects of different subclasses being being treated
similarly because they have the same base class. Encapsilation is conceals certain data 
while giving access to methods with a class. 

9. In Dictator and Lieutenants, there is a heirarchy with the dictator at the top who is 
the only one who can push to the blessed Repository. Developers push to Lieutenants which push
to the Dictator. In the Integration manager workflow, the integration managers handles pushing to 
the blessed repository. Developer pull to their private and push to their public repositories. 

10. The developer don't have to resolve conflicts with the entire repository just the Lieutenant they
are connected with. This also helps prevent issues from reaching the main repository.
